    <p> Draft parties are usually done with multiple people, up to 6 for a draft tournament.</p>
    <p> Drafting is exactly what it sounds like- take a 36-pack booster box of whichever set you please. then, use 6 of those packs to make a deck out of whatever's inside. you're not required to use any basic lands that are inside these packs, the game store you're playing at will supply you with those.</p>
    <p> Others will go through the same process of creating a deck with packs from the same booster box. you'll then play a tournament.</p>
    <p> Players will create a 60-card deck out of the 90 they're given and play with 20 life. </p>
    <p> MTG drafts are usually done at your local game store. can't find one? <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/">Try the wizards affiliated game store locator!</a>
